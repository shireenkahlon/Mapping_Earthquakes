# Mapping_Earthquakes
This project will use JavaScript, APIs, and Leaflet to create a geological map consisting of markers pinpointing earthquakes that have occurred in areas based on latitude and longitude points

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a data visualization on earthquakes in the past seven days. The visualization will be created for the Disaster Reporting Network to inform their audience of earthquakes happening in and around the USA. From this visualization, it can be seen that many of the earthquakes with a higher magnitude (colored orange and red) have occurred on coastal areas. Further geographical research and data collection would need to be conducted to view thew reasoning behind this. The visualization shows the earthquakes happening in a Streets, Satellite, and a Dark view. The user can select to see the earthquakes ranging in minor to severe, where the tectonic plates are located, and view solely the major earthquakes.
